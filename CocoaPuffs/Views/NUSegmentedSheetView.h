/**
 
 NUSegmentedButtonView
 
 \brief    Simulates a segmented control using tabs.
 
 \details  NUSegmentedTabView is not a subclass of NUSegmentedView that
           draws its segments as tabs each with optional image and label.
 
           In this case it does not make much sense to allow multiple 
           selection and the behavior is not specified in that case.
