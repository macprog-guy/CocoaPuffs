/**
 
 NUSegmentedView
 
 \brief    Simulates a segmented control using a view. 
 
 \details  NUSegmentedView is not a subclass of NSControl so it does not offer
           many of the facilities of NSControl. What it does provide is a means
           to display an array of "buttons" or "tabs" or "sheets" for which
           drawing can be customized and the contents bound. 
 
           The class handles mouse tracking and clicks and leaves drawing to
           the user through the use of dedicated methods. Each button is
           represented by a NUSegmentInfo object. Setting the selected 
           property of the info object to YES has the same effect as clicking
           on it. It will work even if selectionIndexes is bounds.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 
 Sets the value of the various rectangles that describe a segment.
 
 \details   There are many rectangles that affect the drawing and behavior of 
            a segment: `selectRects`, `actionRects`, `imageRects`, `textRects` 
            and `badgeRect` are c-arrays of CGRect structures that are created
            for this purpose. The size of these arrays is equal to the number
            of segments.
 
            `selectRects` establishes the rectangular region in which the
            segment is drawn and for which it will responnd to clicks with
            its selectAction.
 
            `actionRects` is optional and establishes another region for which
            the segment will respond to clicks but using its button action
            instead of the selectAction.
 
            `imageRects` are the regions in which the `image` of each segment
            can be drawn. If the rectangle is CGRectNull then no image is drawn.
 
            `textRects` are the regions in which the `name` of each segment
            can be drawn. If the rectangle is CGRectNull then no text is drawn.
 
            `badgeRect` are other regions where a badge image can be drawn.
            If the rectangle is CGRectNull then no badge is drawn.
 
            The default implementation will generate the following rects
            when the alignment is `NSJustifiedTextAlignment`.
            
            +--------+--------------- Select ---------------------+--------+
            |        |                                            |        |
            | Image  | Text                                       | Action |
            |        |                                            |        |
            +--------+--------------------------------------------+--------+

            It will generate the following rects when alignment is something else.

            +--- Select ---+
            |              |
            |  Image/Text  |
            |              |
            +--------------+
 
            You should override this method to compute the rects as needed 
            but you would normally not need to call this method. 
            Call `updateRects` instead.
