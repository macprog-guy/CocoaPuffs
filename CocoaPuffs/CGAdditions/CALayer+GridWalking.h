/**
 
 walkGridInRect:rows:columns:yield
 
 \brief  Splits `rect` into a `rows` by `cols` grid and calls `block`
         once for each sub-rectangle in the grid passing the sub-rect
         and its relative position in the grid.
 
 \details This method is simply issues a call to CGRectWalkGrid().
 
 \param  in  rect   outer bounds of the grid.
 \param  in  rows   number of rows in the grid.
 \param  in  cols   number of columns in the grid.
