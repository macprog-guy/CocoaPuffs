= CocoaPuffs Framework

CocoaPuffs is a Mac OS X framework that adds functionality to many Cocoa and Foundation classes
as well as add a few classes of its own. The following classes have been extended:

- NSObject
- NSString
- NSArray
- NSDictionary
- NSData
- NSMutableDictionary
- NSColor
- NSIndexSet
- NSURL
- NSFont+CFTraits.h
- NSBezierPath
- NSTreeController+Additions.h
- NSMutableData
- NSViewController
- NSView
- NSLayoutConstraint
- NSTableView
- CALayer
- CATextLayer
- CATransaction
- CAKeyFrameAnimation

== Additional Classes

The following new classes are provided:

NUPluginManager: a class that makes loading plugin bundles with callbacks based on UTI conformity very easy.
NUSimpleGradient: a class that has two color properties and one gradient property to facilitate the creation of gradient inspectors using bindings.
NUWeakReference: an object wrapper around a weakly held reference.
NUZeroingDictionary: an NSDictionary that can hold weak references and periodically removes values that have been NUllified.
NUFontSelectionHelper: makes creating custom font inspectors a little bit easier by decomposing the font into bindings compatible properties.
NUUserInterface: helps make unit testing of user interfaces possible and less weak than pure events.

CGColorToNSColorValueTransformer: converts between CGColor and NSColor as the name implies.
NUBlockValueTransformer: one way value transformer using an arbitrary block of code.
NUBoolToNSColorValueTransformer: converts BOOLs to an NSColor which is nice for NSTableViews.
NURoundingValueTransformer: applies a linear transform to a value and rounds the value to a specified NUmber of decimals.
NULayerCoordinateValueTransformer: transforms a point from one layers coordinate system to anothers.

== Additional View Classes

NUDelegatingView: a view that delegates all mouse events (and more) to its delegate when possible.
NUFileBrowserNodeItem: class used by the NUFileBrowserTreeController
NUFileBrowserTreeController: an NSOutlineView that is pre-populated with the content of a directory.
NUFontFamilyMenu: a NSMenu with an entry for each font-family using that font.
NUVolumesPopUpButton: a Popup with existing volumes and additional custom URLs.
