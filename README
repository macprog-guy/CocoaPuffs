= CocoaPuffs Framework

CocoaPuffs is a Mac OS X framework that adds functionality to many Cocoa and Foundation classes as well as add a few classes of its own. The following classes have been extended:

- NSObject
- NSString
- NSArray
- NSDictionary
- NSData
- NSMutableDictionary
- NSColor
- NSIndexSet
- NSURL
- NSFont+CFTraits.h
- NSBezierPath
- NSTreeController+Additions.h
- NSMutableData
- NSViewController
- NSView
- NSLayoutConstraint
- NSTableView
- CALayer
- CATextLayer
- CATransaction
- CAKeyFrameAnimation

== Additional Classes

The following new classes are provided:

NUPluginManager: a class that makes loading plugin bundles with callbacks based on UTI conformity very easy.
NUSimpleGradient: a class that has two color properties and one gradient property to facilitate the creation of gradient inspectors using bindings.
NUWeakReference: an object wrapper around a weakly held reference.
NUZeroingDictionary: an NSDictionary that can hold weak references and periodically removes values that have been NUllified.
NUFontSelectionHelper: makes creating custom font inspectors a little bit easier by decomposing the font into bindings compatible properties.
NUUserInterface: helps make unit testing of user interfaces possible and less weak than pure events.

CGColorToNSColorValueTransformer: converts between CGColor and NSColor as the name implies.
NUBlockValueTransformer: one way value transformer using an arbitrary block of code.
NUBoolToNSColorValueTransformer: converts BOOLs to an NSColor which is nice for NSTableViews.
NURoundingValueTransformer: applies a linear transform to a value and rounds the value to a specified NUmber of decimals.
NULayerCoordinateValueTransformer: transforms a point from one layers coordinate system to anothers.

== Additional View Classes

NUDelegatingView: a view that delegates all mouse events (and more) to its delegate when possible.
NUFileBrowserNodeItem: class used by the NUFileBrowserTreeController
NUFileBrowserTreeController: an NSOutlineView that is pre-populated with the content of a directory.
NUFontFamilyMenu: a NSMenu with an entry for each font-family using that font.
NUVolumesPopUpButton: a Popup with existing volumes and additional custom URLs.
NUPropertyInspectorView: WORK-IN-PROGRESS inspector for a single property. Works with NUPropertySheetView.
NUPropertySheetView: WORK-IN-PROGRESS a collection of stacked properties inspectors with a title and a disclosure button. Put many of these in a NSStackedView: a view that vertically stacks its subviews with an optional row-spacing.
NURangeSlider: a two knob range slider.
NUSegmentedView: base class of other segmented views.
NUSegmentedButtonView: similar to NSSegmentedControl except that you can bind each button individually.
NUSegmentedTabView: same as NSSegmentedButtonView except that it draws tabs at the top instead of buttons.
NUSegmentedSheetView: same as NSSegmenedButtonView except that it draws "sorta" tabs at the bottom that look more like those in excel.
NUSelectableView: Just a view that resizes it only subview to fit its bounds. Bind its contentView to a NSSegmentedButtonView.selectedObject.representedObject.view and you effectively have a nice looking tab view.
NUSplitbarView: Makes it easier to have a whole bar that can act as a splitter. The bar is an arbitrary view that can contain other controls.
NUStackedView: a view that simply stacks its subviews vertically (with an optional rowSpacing) and has their widths fill the width of its bounds.
